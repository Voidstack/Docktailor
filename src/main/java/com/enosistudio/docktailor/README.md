# DOCKTAILOR

## Getting started

Fork of FxDock by andy-goryyachev
The library is a dockable window framework for JavaFX.

## Why?

Added methods/refactoring/fixes - the original code is poor/incomplete and contains major bugs

## TODO

1. Multi-screen management

## BUGS IN THE BASE LIBRARY

### 002

1. Drag and drop a window onto itself
2. An empty tab is created

### 003

1. Full screen configuration save (bug)

### 004
